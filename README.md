# 👋 Hi, I’m Chahat Kashwani

I don’t just write code — I focus on building **reliable, scalable, and practical software systems**.

---

## 🚀 About Me
Final-year **Computer Science Engineering** student with a strong interest in  
**backend systems, cloud-native development, and applied AI**.

I enjoy working on problems where **clean architecture, correctness, and real-world usability** matter more than quick hacks.

I believe in:
- Simplicity over unnecessary complexity  
- Strong fundamentals over shortcuts  
- Understanding *why* before implementing *how*

---

## 🧠 What I’m Working On
- Backend systems and RESTful APIs  
- AI-powered applications with real-world relevance  
- Cloud & DevOps fundamentals (containers, CI/CD, Linux)  
- System-level thinking for scalable software design  

My focus is on **projects that solve actual problems**, not just academic exercises.

## 📈 Engineering Mindset
- System design before implementation  
- Readable and maintainable code matters  
- Edge cases are part of the problem  
- Documentation is not optional  

I write code assuming **someone else will read and maintain it**.
